# Assignment 1 — GitHub Pages Homework Table

**Course context:** Completed as part of USC **CSCI 571 Web Technologies** (Spring 2025), under **Professor Marco Papa**.

## What this project is
A single **static HTML page** published via **GitHub Pages (private)** that lists all homework assignments in a table with links to each assignment’s **homepage** (frontend) and **cloud service** (backend endpoint). It serves as a simple, tamper‑resistant hub for graders and reviewers.

## Key features
- Clean, accessible table with clearly labeled links.
- Private GitHub Pages repo (via Student Pack) to comply with course policy.
- Scrambled filename to avoid guessable URLs.

## Tech stack
- **HTML** + **CSS** (no JS required)
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages (private)**

## Engineering highlights
- Focus on reliability and link hygiene over features.
- Simple styling and layout for fast load and easy maintenance.
